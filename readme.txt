Hash_Modulus_Test.py is a simple Python program designed to test using various data points whether the (Better) Hash Function described in the Udacity CS101 course is more cost efficient using a single modulus or using multiple moduli.  

To use this program, merely run the included Python file.  It will use the default conditions to evaluate the time spent hashing.  To modify conditions one must currently modify the Python file.  The variables are clearly identified by octothorpe commented lines.

Feel free to use this program, any part or in whole, for your own projects.  It is best, however, if you use substantial portions of the code in your own work to site me as a source.
